-- One IR-designation predicate, party-private expiry reasons, and a lock
-- order that cannot deadlock a drop against an accept.
--
-- private.is_ir_designation is read by the ineligible-IR list and the IR
-- toggle. The league-wide activity row for an offer that expired because an
-- asset left no longer names the asset; the reason stays on the trade. The
-- roster lifecycle trigger ignores old-season rows outright. Accepting a
-- trade locks the parties and players first, in the order every roster
-- mutation uses, then the trade row. The rookie-draft guard's message says
-- what can actually happen to an accepted trade.
