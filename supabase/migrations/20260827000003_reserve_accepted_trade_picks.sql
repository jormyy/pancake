-- Reserve picks in accepted trades.
--
-- Players in an accepted trade were already reserved (drops and IR/taxi moves
-- are rejected) but a pick could still be used in a draft or re-owned during
-- the veto window, which later failed the completed acceptance. Picks now get
-- the same reservation; trade completion marks its transaction so the guard
-- lets its own moves through. The nested pending-offer expiry restores that
-- flag instead of clearing it, and a player merge clears a waiver window for
-- an identity that is already rostered. Found by tests/db/roster-lifecycle-oracle.sql.
