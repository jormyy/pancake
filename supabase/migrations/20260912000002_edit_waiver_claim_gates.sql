-- edit_waiver_claim_atomic skipped the gates create_waiver_claim_atomic applies,
-- so a pending claim could be edited after the league left an eligible state,
-- after the season rolled, after the weekly add limit was exhausted, or after
-- the player's waiver window closed, and a member could set drop_player_id to
-- the claimed player. The edit now applies the same checks as creation.
