-- Invite, trade, and lineup hardening:
-- - Serialize invite-code joins with draft/lifecycle transitions by locking
--   the league row before the setup-status gate.
-- - Preserve already-started/current-day lineup rows when completing accepted
--   trades, so trade cron cannot erase earned points after tipoff.
