-- Fix merge_players() 23505 collisions on UNIQUE player_id tables
--
-- merge_players() de-duplicates the loser's rows before re-pointing player_id
-- for player_projections and player_game_stats, but did BLIND UPDATEs for three
-- other tables with a player_id-scoped UNIQUE constraint:
--   roster_players  UNIQUE(league_id, league_season_id, player_id)
--   weekly_lineups  UNIQUE(league_id, league_season_id, member_id, player_id, game_date)
--   nominations     UNIQUE(draft_id, player_id)
-- When both duplicate player UUIDs are concurrently in scope (both rostered in a
-- league/season, both nominated in a draft, or both in a lineup for the same
-- game_date), re-pointing the loser collides with the winner row, raising 23505
-- and rolling back the whole merge — so the duplicate persists and re-fails the
-- daily sync. Apply the same DELETE-then-UPDATE guard used for the other tables.
-- Idempotent (CREATE OR REPLACE); preserves all other behavior + SET search_path.
