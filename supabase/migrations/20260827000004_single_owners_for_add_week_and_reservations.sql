--
-- private.current_add_week owns the add-week number and its reset instant;
-- current_add_week_number and weekly_add_limit_resets_at are projections of it
-- and the time zone lives in private.add_week_timezone. The weekly add limit
-- raises SQLSTATE PA001 so the API and the app classify it without parsing
-- the message, and the waiver processor uses the same assertion instead of its
-- own copy (its failure reason now carries the reset instant too).
-- private.is_reserved_trade_asset replaces seven inline copies of the
-- accepted-trade reservation check. begin/end_trade_lifecycle_write own the
-- transaction mark that trade completion and offer expiry set.
-- Player merges re-point trade-block listings next to the other re-pointed
-- tables in merge_players, so the roster trigger no longer watches player_id.
