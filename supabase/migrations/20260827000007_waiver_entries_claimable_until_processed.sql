-- Waiver entries stay claimable until the run processes them.
--
-- A player whose 48-hour window had ended but whose entry was not processed
-- yet (the run is daily at 3 AM ET) could be neither added (the uncleared-entry
-- guard rejects the add) nor claimed (the claim RPC required clears_at in the
-- future). Claims now attach to any uncleared entry; the run still processes
-- them in priority order, so waiver priority never loses to the fastest add.
-- "On waivers" rejections carry SQLSTATE PA002 so the app can route to the
-- claim flow. tests/db/waiver-clearing-window.sql covers the window.
